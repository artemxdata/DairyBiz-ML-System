CowMilk-AI-Predictor

Project Description
Dairy farming remains one of the key sectors of the agro-industrial complex, requiring a scientifically-based approach to herd formation and management. For the dairy farm "Volny Lug" (Free Meadow), it is critically important to objectively assess the productive potential of cows when expanding the herd to minimize risks and ensure stable production development. Available data includes information about the current livestock, including animal characteristics, feeding parameters, housing conditions, and milk productivity indicators. This data will enable building predictive models for key productivity parameters of new animals.

Research Objective
Development of a machine learning model system for predicting annual milk yield and milk quality of cows, enabling informed decisions when selecting animals for herd expansion. Primary focus will be on analyzing the impact of breed characteristics, feeding parameters, housing conditions, and genetic factors on productivity.

Research Workflow
* Data loading and exploration
* Data preprocessing and dataset merging
* Exploratory data analysis
* Feature preparation and model creation
* Model training and validation
* Application to cows for purchase

General Conclusion
The analysis will identify key factors affecting milk productivity: breed, age, feeding parameters, pasture type, and genetic characteristics. Special attention will be given to creating two complementary models: a regression model for predicting milk yield and a classification model for determining the probability of producing tasty milk. Results will form the basis for objective animal selection criteria and risk reduction when investing in herd expansion.

Research Plan
The study aims to:
1. Create a regression model for predicting annual cow milk yield
2. Develop a classification model for assessing the probability of producing tasty milk
3. Analyze the impact of breed characteristics and housing conditions on productivity
4. Investigate the relationship between feeding parameters and milk quality indicators
5. Apply models to evaluate 20 cows proposed for purchase
6. Prepare practical recommendations for animal selection considering criteria: yield of at least 6000 kg per year and high milk quality

Expected Results
The obtained results will help the dairy farm "Volny Lug" more accurately predict the productivity of purchased animals, minimize financial risks, and ensure sustainable development of high-quality dairy production.
